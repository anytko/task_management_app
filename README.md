## Description
This task management web application utilizes React and Redux to manage past, current, and future tasks on an online calendar.

## Usage
This application allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks on a calendar. Specifically, users can select from a decade, year, month, and day of their choosing. Users can add tasks under the "Current Tasks" list and check off these tasks upon completion. Completed tasks are displayed under the "Past Tasks" list. Users can also delete tasks and remove the task lists and add task options if desired. To contact the web developer, users can utilize a contact form that can be accessed using the navigation bar. **Form responses are uploaded and organized using formspree.io.**
